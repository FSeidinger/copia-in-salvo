# Copia in Salvo

## Preface
Copia in Salvo or CIS is a modern and highly scalable backup system.

Its name is derived from the Medieval Latin word "copia" and the latin term "In salvo". The
original meaning of copia was derived from ops, opis which means power, ability or resources.
Copia was mainly used by lawyers when they added a copy of a law text to their chambers library
and thus extended their power their ability and their ressources compared to other chambers.
Since the 14. century it changed to the meaning of copy which stayed until today. The latin
term "In salvo" means to be in saftey.

Thus Copia in Salvo does just what is says. It takes your copies in safety.
